* Array types
  * Storage management types
    * Dense grids, i.e. grid index to buffer index mapping in traits
 	  * Linear layout
	  * Templated fixed strides

	  * Hierarchical brick layout
	* Dynamically allocated
	* Scatter grid (hashtable)
	* Cached grid
	* Null grid
        * Bit grid, really a view on an int grid
          * Bit count pr word is power of 2
          * Bit count arbitrary (more expensive div and mod)
          * Use any base (e.g. base 5 for values 0..4). i.e. stored_value = x0*5^0 + x1*5^1 ...
            This will be very slow...
	* Transactional grid for tracking changes
	* Recycle grid.  keep pool of recent tiles, recency parametrized.
  * Views
    * Value transform (unit, value type, unit circle, ...)
    * Slices, same dimensionality or lower
    * Range checking
    * Decimated
    * Sub-area view (== decimated)
    * Super-area read-only view.  Outside area is novalue (padding)
    * Track changes (as bounding box)
    * Cached view
    * Transform from multiple inputs, f(x1,x2, ..., xN)
  * Functionality
    * Expression templates for full expressions, i.e. C = A + B*3 + pow(2, C);
    * clear
    * copy_slice
    * optimized for low dimensionality, i.e. unrolling loops
    * general n-dimensional indexing for generic programming (should be view?)
    * special indexing for low-dimension (<=4) data, i.e. (i,j,k) for 3d.
    * slices for extents/from..to ranges
    * generic slices, map index
  * Iterators
    * Tiled iteration
    * Master/slave iterator

    * LRU
    * Random
    * 1-way associative
    * N-way set-associate & LRU
    * ARC, an adaptive cache algorithm (mix LRU/LFU).  Estimate when random is better?

  * Optimize FIR filter.  Load input data to registers as little as possible.
